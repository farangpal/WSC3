                        Wonder Secret Club is a new art project born from the fusion of a nostalgic worldview and web3.<br>
                        The story is about a group of children who are good friends and take on various mysterious incidents that occur in the fictional town of Fortville (FORTVILL). The emphasis is on the story and setting, including nostalgic and mysterious developments.<br><br>
                        The collection features 5,555 unique characters. The art we are offering is the complete opposite of the colorful and quirky art of the NFT space, with most of the pieces in grayscale to represent a retro and nostalgic worldview.
